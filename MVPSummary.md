# MVP Summary

Here is a summary of things I hope to achieve with this project:

1. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
2. One Sentence Summarizer of the entire song and Topic Modeling
3. One Sentence that represents the song (not the same as point 2)
4. Recommendation System 
5. Have breakdowns and question why I'm doing Data Science, and whether I am even capable of becoming a Data Scientist


### Domain
A brief description of the domain you're working in, and a discussion of your familiarity with this domain

For this project, I would interested to explore if I am able to cluster by their genre based on their lyrics. To get the lyrics, I will be scraping genius.com as their API does not have a lyrics endpoint. As well as leveraging existing dataset on Kaggle.

I am interested in this project, because I would like to work in the entertainment industry after the bootcamp. Particularly with music, and especially at Spotify. Hence the general theme of my projects and investigations.

I would like to be able to use this project as a way to familiarize myself with recommendation systems, and understanding user behavior of music consumption. By being able to cluster songs by genre (unsupervised portion of my project), and exploring other cool things I could do in the next two weeks, I am hoping to develop a deeper knowledge in this domain.

I am an avid consumer of data, and am very enthusiastic of all music products, especially Spotify.

### Data
A table with variables name and variable type fields, listing the variables you'd like to utilize

Here are some links to the Kaggle datasets that I am interested in.

https://www.kaggle.com/artimous/every-song-you-have-heard-almost#Lyrics2.csv

Please note, that I will also be building upon my Project 2 ('Drop it like it's Hot') and using that dataset as a starter for additional songs that I would be interested in adding to my dataset for this project.

I have not done any work on this project so far, so I cannot elaborate on the specific variables I am interested in. I will be using the lyrics for each song as a means to classify them into genre clusters. I would be happy to talk further, and flesh out additional details of this project in person! Please let me know if that is something you're interested in.

### Known unknowns
A list of items with an unclear level of effort, or which will require special attention

Knowns: I want to do this project on music classification using song lyrics (and if permitted, other aspects of the song).
Unknown: All the unsupervised learning algorithms. BUT I WILL BE AN EXPERT WHEN IT COMES TO THE END OF THIS PROJECT (I hope so...).

As always, please let me know if there are any outstanding concerns. I would love as much feedback as possible so that I am able to make the necessary changes early on and adjust my timeline.
