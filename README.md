# Project Summary for Project 4 Fletcher


## Project Design and Research
Day 1 (August 11, 2018):
I am very excited to begin this project. However, I think like most people I am having trouble figuring out what question I want my project to answer. So far, I've been picking projects that appeal to my innate curiousity of the world--of course aligning with my interests and what problems I hope to answer later on in my career. However, it's difficult to identify the business/use case for these questions. 

To summarize, what is the value that my project will bring to the world? What impact will it make?

This is not to say that I don't think doing things for the sake of doing them is not important. I think it's great to just dive deep into a problem/industry that piques your interest. However, a large part of the bootcamp is learn and master different Data Science tools to create a portfolio that would help me get a job after the bootcamp.

I have 3 areas that I am MOST passionate about (but not just 3):
1. Music and Media
2. Food
3. Dating

I don't have a hard time finding questions in these domains to answer. I am very eager to get a chance to delve into these realms and extract nuggets of insight to present to my peers. However, how do I answer a valuable business question?


August 14th, 2018--More things to add..
I found some datasets on Kaggle that will help to supplement my project. At this point, I have decided to try to cluster songs into genres based on their lyrics. 

Here are some links to the Kaggle datasets that I am interested in.

https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics#songdata.csv 
https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics. 
https://www.kaggle.com/artimous/every-song-you-have-heard-almost#Lyrics2.csv

This is also in addition to the list of songs that I still have from my Project 2 ('Drop it like it's Hot') that I scraped from the Billboards Top 100.

I am also interested in trying to use the songs in my own personal Spotify library and throwing those songs in there. Sounds like fun.

Here is what I hope to achieve with this project:

Here is a summary of things I hope to achieve with this project:

1. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
2. One Sentence Summarizer of the entire song and Topic Modeling
3. One Sentence that represents the song (not the same as point 2)
4. Recommendation System

and if time permits, the classic:

5. Have breakdowns and question why I'm doing Data Science, and whether I am even capable of becoming a Data Scientist

Here is my plan today.
I want to finish writing the function that I will use to scrape genius.com, and have that running in the background tonight while I sleep. That way I will have data to play with the next day.

I also want to spend some time to create a game plan for myself so that I can start completing things in a more a systematic way.

Update:
Here are some links that I want to bookmart and re-visit if I have the time to do so. I want to put my own data into it.
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/playlists/
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/playlists/get-list-users-playlists/
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/playlists/get-playlists-tracks/
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/library/save-tracks-user/

I think it would also be interesting to see what clustering the lyrics does (does the definition of difference genres change over the decades?)


August 15th, 2018:
Addendum:
I think to reframe the scope of the project, I will be using songs from the billboards top 100 and my personal spotify library + playlists.

Then when I'm done, I'm going to build a personal recommendation system
