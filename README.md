# Project Summary for Project 4 Fletch


## Project Design and Research
Day 1 (August 11, 2018):
I am very excited to begin this project. However, I think like most people I am having trouble figuring out what question I want my project to answer. So far, I've been picking projects that appeal to my innate curiousity of the world--of course aligning with my interests and what problems I hope to answer later on in my career. However, it's difficult to identify the business/use case for these questions. 

To summarize, what is the value that my project will bring to the world? What impact will it make?

This is not to say that I don't think doing things for the sake of doing them is not important. I think it's great to just dive deep into a problem/industry that piques your interest. However, a large part of the bootcamp is learn and master different Data Science tools to create a portfolio that would help me get a job after the bootcamp.

I have 3 areas that I am MOST passionate about (but not just 3):
1. Music and Media
2. Food
3. Dating

I don't have a hard time finding questions in these domains to answer. I am very eager to get a chance to delve into these realms and extract nuggets of insight to present to my peers. However, how do I answer a valuable business question?
